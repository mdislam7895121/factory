# Proof Evidence Directory

This directory contains proof outputs for each serial phase of the Factory project.

## Structure
- Each serial gets its own subdirectory: `serial-01/`, `serial-02/`, etc.
- Each subdirectory contains:
  - `proof.md` - Main proof document with commands and outputs
  - Any additional logs or screenshots

## Usage
Run `scripts/proof.ps1 -Serial <number>` to automatically generate proof documentation.
